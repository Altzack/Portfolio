        <p>
          Hey there! I’m a software developer with a passion for front-end work—taking ideas
          from a blank screen all the way to a smooth, interactive experience. I love being
          creative, whether it’s drawing up a playful animation or finding just the right shade
          of color to guide a user’s eye.
        </p>

   

        <p>
          At the end of the day, I want my work to look great, yes—but even more, I want it to
          work flawlessly. I’m all about crafting interfaces that feel intuitive, load quickly,
          and leave users satisfied. Let’s build something awesome
          together!
        </p>
